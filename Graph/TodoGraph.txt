BFS w/wh recursion

DFS w/wh recursion

all shortest paths

pre-order
in-order
post=order

find bridge edges:
	-build tree out of graph
	- postorder nodes
	- compute #of descendants
	- per node get highest and lowest (directly) reachable node
	- bridge edge: is tree edge, and max<nodenum and min>nodenum-number of descendants
